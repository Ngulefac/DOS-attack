# What is a DDoS Attack?

- A Distributable Denied-of-Service (DDOS) attack server that cuts off targets or surrounding infrastructure in a flood of Internet traffic (usually done with serveral host computers)....

- A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. ... Popular flood attacks include: Buffer overflow attacks ‚Äì 

- DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness using multiple compromised computer systems as a source of attack traffic. Search engines may include computers and other network resources such as IoT devices.

- From a higher level, the DDOS attack is like an unexpected traffic jam stuck on a highway, preventing regular traffic from reaching its destination.
